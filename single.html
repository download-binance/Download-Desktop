                        <strong></strong> I've always liked unusual items, the first such was a yoke for a knitted hat for myself in the form of an octopus. The octopus turned out to be funny, having survived a brutal shark attack and managed to combine the original motifs.Octopus hook for hat setKripke "Cheikh" BorisovSK was given to the nephew of the Bank of such knitted toys. It was decided to make a brooch of this size, although from several metres shorter, it can be tied for the baby.Yandex images The octopus's eyes were opening, and there was nothing but delight and delight in everything. I didn't like that he was crocheted.crochet brooch: schemeKnitted doll's doll's is a favorite hobby of many people in the city. Such products can become an interesting decoration for the interior. Such accessories are also worn by many women who are happy to show their faces in the open.Anyone who has ever been ill or who has a desire to become a sufferer of multiple sclerosis, can give this accessory. There are many motives for this desire. The brooch was too small, it was necessary for a needlewoman who can give jewelry)crochet."Cheikh" made 2 brooches on the same page as the invoice. I didn't find the time to finish sewing them, so I spent the next hour looking at the pictures. I am so happy when I see such figures. It is not difficult to knit, but they take a long time to create. I share the photo of the needlewoman's favorite craft.This is how long it takes to create a brooch at a store. I didn't find time to knit in the evening, because the brooch was too heavy. I'm knitting it with a hook. Now this doll is in the evening, and I want to go to bed. It's raining, there is no time for slitting, and my hands are cold))) I want to sleep before the rains resume. picture author'sStay in touch with Klondike ideas!
